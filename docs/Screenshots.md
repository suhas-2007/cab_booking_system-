## Screenshot Capture and File Organization

- Save screenshots as:  
  `01_welcome_screen.png`  
  `02_input_booking_type.png`  
  `03_input_ride_date.png`  
  ... up to `10_final_goodbye.png`
- Place all screenshots in a `screenshots/` folder.
- When embedding in documentation, use:
![Welcome](screenshots/01

text

## Practical Tips

- Maximize terminal, use a readable font.
- Take screenshots after each relevant system or user prompt.
- Crop excess borders and only show the terminal.
- Use one color scheme/theme throughout for consistency.

## Expected Output (OOP Concept-Wise)

This section gives sample output divided according to the main OOP concepts demonstrated.

---

### 1. Encapsulation

All information is only displayed using public methods.

    Welcome to Ride Booking System!
    Are you booking for yourself or someone else? (self/other): self
    Enter your name: Amit
    Enter your mobile number: 9000112233
    Enter your gender (male/female): male

text

### 2. Inheritance

Different vehicle types/subtypes derived from Vehicle base class.

    Choose Vehicle Type:

    Car

    Bike

    Auto
    Choice: 1
    Choose car type:

    Sedan

    SUV
    Choice: 1

    Available drivers for 9/11/2025:

    Name: Ajay, Gender: male, Mobile: 8899001100, Avg. Rating: 4.3, Vehicle: Car (Sedan), Number: KA01SED1001
    ...
  
text

### 3. Polymorphism

    displayDetails() resolves at runtime for each vehicle/driver.
    Available drivers for 9/11/2025:

    Name: Ajay, Gender: male, Mobile: 8899001100, Avg. Rating: 4.3, Vehicle: Car (Sedan), Number: KA01SED1001

    Name: Manish, Gender: male, Mobile: 9234567812, Avg. Rating: 4.5, Vehicle: Car (Sedan), Number: KA02SED2002
    ...
  
    Driver: Manish, ID: 105, Gender: male, Mobile: 9234567812, Avg. Rating: 4.5
    Vehicle Assigned: Car (Sedan), Number: KA02SED2002

text

### 4. Abstraction

Exposes only needed prompts, prints and summary, logic is hidden.

    Estimated fare for your trip: ₹752.00

    Options before allocation:
    A. Cancel Ride & give feedback
    B. Continue ride (back to options)
    C. Request Decrease Fare
    D. Increase Fare for faster allocation
    E. Continue with current fare
    Choose option (A/B/C/D/E): E

text

### 5. Composition
